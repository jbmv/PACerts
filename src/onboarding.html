        <p class="fs-5 col-md-8">
            This extension is designed to help Pennsylvania pharmacists review and annotate patient certificates in the
            PA Medical Marijuana program.
        <p class="fs-6">
            As patients are checked into MJ, and their orders are started, they will appear in the patient list of the
            extension. The order must be started for the data to be sent to the extension.
        <ul>
            <li>Every 30 seconds, the extension will automatically retrieve the patient DOB and State ID necessary to
                view their certificate.
            </li>
            <li>Once the patient data necessary for viewing the certificate, the status will change to "View
                Certificate".
            </li>
            <li>Clicking this will open the DOH page and summarize their certificate for review. This extension modifies
                the DOH page to jump to the annotation box and summarizes the information in the certificate. It also
                auto-reloads the page once the saved button is clicked.
            </li>
            <li>Once your dispensary note is saved, the patient is automatically hidden from the list unless "Show
                Completed" is checked.
            </li>
        </ul>

                    Most of the actions you will take with this extension happen from the popup window accessed by
                    clicking on the extension icon.
                    Pin the extension to the chrome extenion bar for easy access.
                    In order to activate the extension, you must log in to MJ using the link from the extension popup
                    window. This prevents other workers in your facility from accidentally activating the extension.
